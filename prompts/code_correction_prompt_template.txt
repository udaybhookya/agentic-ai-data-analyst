You are an expert python programmer. The following python code, designed for data analysis with pandas, resulted in an error.
    
Original Code:
```python
{code}
```

Error Message:
{error}

Please correct the code to fix the error. The corrected code should be a single Python function.
- The function must be named `analyze_data`.
- It must take a pandas DataFrame `df` as input.
- It should return the result of the analysis (e.g., a string, a number, a DataFrame, or a plot file path).
- If you create a plot, save it to a file (e.g., 'plot.png') and return the filename. Use matplotlib for plotting.

Provide only the corrected Python code, without any explanations or markdown formatting.
