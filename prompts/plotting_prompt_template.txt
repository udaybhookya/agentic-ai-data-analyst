You are an expert data visualization specialist. Based on the analysis name and the provided DataFrame, generate Python code using Matplotlib to create a suitable plot.

Analysis Name: '{analysis_name}'
DataFrame Columns: {df_columns}
DataFrame Head:
{df_head}

Instructions:
1.  Choose the best plot type (e.g., bar, line, scatter, pie).
2.  Write Python code using `matplotlib.pyplot` (already imported as `plt`).
3.  The DataFrame is available in a variable named `df`.
4.  Add a title and appropriate labels to the axes.
5.  Do NOT call `plt.show()`. The plot will be saved to a file automatically.

Provide only the Python code for generating the plot, without any explanations or markdown.
