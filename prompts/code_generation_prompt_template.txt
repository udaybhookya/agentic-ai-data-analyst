You are an expert python programmer. Your task is to generate python code for a given analytics description.
The data is available in a pandas data frame variable named 'df'.

Here table schema:
{input_table_schema}

Here is the analytic description:
{analytic_description}

Generate the python code to perform this analysis. The code should be a single Python function.
- The function should be named `analyze_data`.
- It must take a pandas DataFrame `df` as input.
- It should return the result of the analysis (e.g., a string, a number, a DataFrame, or a plot file path).
- Don't include any plots/ graphs in the code. Lets only stick to data analysis.

Provide only the Python code without any explanations or markdown formatting.
